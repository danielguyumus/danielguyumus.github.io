I am a Civil Engineer and current Ph.D. candidate focused on advancing groundwater representation in land surface models to improve weather prediction. My teaching experience spans various roles, including serving as a teaching assistant (TA) for courses such as Fluid Mechanics, Environmental Spatial Data Analysis at Duke University, and Hydrosystem Modeling at the Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia, as well as leading lab sessions for Fluid Mechanics.

I have had the opportunity to serve as a guest lecturer in the courses of Hydrology, Hydrosystem Modeling, and River Hydraulics. I have experience teaching in both laboratory environments for undergraduate students and lecture settings for graduate students. Central to my teaching philosophy is fostering intuition and encouraging students to challenge misconceptions, with a particular interest in exploring the applicability and limitations of key concepts within my discipline.

In designing and planning learning activities, I prioritize values of transparency and respect. The assignments I developed for two of my guest lectures were grounded in real-world applications and closely aligned with the practical tools introduced during the lectures. I created clear instructions and accompanying lecture slides to ensure that students understand expectations and processes. To accommodate diverse student needs and learning contexts, I provided course material in advance, adapted explanations in response to confusion, and offered alternative examples as needed. My approach in lab sessions includes sharing explicit guidelines for student reports, further supporting transparency and clarity. 

I encourage students to maintain open communication, and I use positive reinforcement and active listening when responding to their questions. The effectiveness of these strategies was reflected in the quality of student work, which I assessed on time with constructive feedback during the grading process. These practices help me foster an equitable and engaging environment. 

In my teaching practice, I foster active and inclusive learning environments across both classes and labs. During lab sessions, I introduce the fundamental concepts behind each experiment, clearly outline the procedures, and prompt students to predict possible outcomes. By allowing students to collaborate on experimental tasks, I encourage peer-to-peer learning and hands-on engagement. In lectures, I incorporate animated material to capture studentsâ€™ attention and facilitate an intuitive understanding of complex ideas. For more abstract topics, I encourage participation with open-ended questions and active listening, repeating back the question to the students. To promote equitable participation, I clearly communicate expectations for assignments and lab reports, ensuring students understand the criteria for success regardless of background. In a lab setting, I would invite students to hypothesize explanations for observed phenomena, providing a supportive environment in which they can develop a deeper understanding. I have observed that students engage more easily when allowed to apply concepts, share ideas, and reflect on their reasoning.

I see assessments as a key element in building a deeper understanding. In a lecture setting, I use concept checks to help me identify a starting point for the lecture and to clarify misconceptions. To ensure fairness and transparency, I provide clear assignment prompts and offer constructive feedback on lab reports and homework submissions. I also engage students in discussions about assessments to maintain academic integrity and clarify expectations. Formative feedback is supported through digital platforms like Canvas, providing students with timely, written responses they can use to improve their work. This helps students reflect on their learning and make meaningful progress. By promoting ongoing dialogue, I aim to create a supportive and equitable learning environment where feedback becomes a tool for growth.
