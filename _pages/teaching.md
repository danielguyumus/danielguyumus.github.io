I am a Civil Engineer and current Ph.D. candidate focused on advancing groundwater representation in land surface models to improve weather prediction. My teaching experience includes serving as a teaching assistant (TA) for courses in Fluid Mechanics, Environmental Spatial Data Analysis, and Hydrosystem Modeling at Duke University and Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia.

I have had the opportunity to serve as a guest lecturer in the courses of Hydrology, Hydrosystem Modeling, and River Hydraulics. I have experience teaching in both laboratory environments for undergraduate students and lecture settings for graduate students. My teaching philosophy is to foster intuition and build structured knowledge through problem-solving strategies, with a particular interest in exploring the applicability and limitations of key concepts within surface hydrology, hydrometeorology, and hydroinformatics.

## A1. Designing and Planning for Learning Activities

In designing and planning learning activities, I prioritize values of transparency and respect. As a guest lecturer for Hydrosystems Modeling and River Hydraulics, the assignments I developed were grounded in real-world applications and closely aligned with the practical tools introduced during the lectures. I created clear instructions and accompanying lecture slides to ensure that students understand expectations and processes. To accommodate diverse student needs, I provided course material in advance, adapted explanations in response to confusion, and offered alternative examples as needed [V3, K1]. As a TA in Fluid Mechanics, my approach in lab sessions included adapting guidelines in communication with the Faculty, sharing explicit expectations for student reports, and further supporting transparency and clarity [V5, K2]. 

As a TA, I use positive reinforcement and active listening when responding to students’ questions, as well as encouraging open communication [V1]. The effectiveness of these strategies was reflected in the quality of student work, which I assessed in a timely manner with constructive feedback during the grading process. These practices help me create an equitable and engaging environment [K1]. 


## A2. Teaching and Supporting Student Learning

I adopt an active and inclusive learning environment across both Lectures and labs. During lab sessions, I introduce the fundamental concepts behind each experiment, clearly outline the procedures, and prompt students to predict possible outcomes. I invite students to hypothesize explanations for observed phenomena, providing a supportive environment in which they can develop a deeper understanding. By allowing students to collaborate on experimental tasks, I encourage peer-to-peer learning and hands-on engagement [V2, K2]. In lectures, I incorporate animated material to capture students’ attention and facilitate an intuitive understanding of complex ideas [K4]. For more abstract topics, I encourage participation with open-ended questions and active listening, repeating back the question to the students. To promote equitable participation, I clearly communicate expectations for assignments, ensuring students understand the criteria for success [V1, K1]. 

I have observed that students engage more easily when allowed to apply concepts, share ideas, and reflect on their reasoning. 

## A3. Assessing and Giving Feedback for Learning

I see assessments as a key element in building a deeper understanding. In a lecture setting, I use concept checks to help me identify a starting point for the lecture and to clarify misconceptions [V3]. To ensure fairness and transparency, I provide clear assignment prompts and offer constructive feedback on lab reports and homework submissions. I also engage students in one-on-one assessment discussions to maintain academic integrity and clarify expectations for them [V2, K2]. Formative feedback is supported through digital platforms, such as Canvas, providing students with timely, written responses that they can use to improve their work [K4]. This helps students reflect on their learning and make meaningful progress. By promoting ongoing dialogue, my goal is to build a supportive and fair learning environment where feedback is used to drive growth.
